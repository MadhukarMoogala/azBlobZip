We had a requirement to serve a zip file from of selected Azure blob files from a given container to [Forge Design Automation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview/) service
Most of my searches went in vain, either they are related to ASP .NET or not working any more, this project takes inspiration from [Generate a Zip file from Azure Blob Storage Files](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip141.html)

This project is based on ASP .NET Core 3.1 technology, I have created a single REST endpoint `api/download` that will serve a zip file to the client, we can pass this server endpoint to Forge Design Automation services, `workitem` input URL.
